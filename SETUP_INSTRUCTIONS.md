3. Try asking "What MCP servers are available?"

### Manual Server Start (Optional):
If automatic start doesn't work, you can manually start the server:
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\Aeciu\OneDrive\Desktop\Smartscout\mcp-smartscout-domo`
3. Run: `start-server.bat`
4. Keep the window open while using Claude

### Check Logs:
If issues persist, check:
- Claude Desktop logs in `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs`
- Server output in the command window (if manually started)

## Current Limitations
- Only 5 datasets are accessible (products, brands, sellers, productHistories, searchTerms)
- Some advanced features requiring other datasets won't work
- Use custom queries for complex analysis

## Support
For dataset indexing or access issues, contact your Domo administrator.
