- Results include a count and truncation notice when applicable
- Complex queries return summarized data

## Database Schema

The server provides access to these SmartScout databases:

- **PRODUCTS**: Product catalog (16.1M rows)
- **BRANDS**: Brand performance (350K rows)
- **SELLERS**: Seller profiles (374K rows)

Use `smartscout_system_info` to explore available databases and their schemas.

## Query Approach

This MCP server uses Domo's SQL query API. Key points about how queries work:

1. **Dataset Selection**: Each tool targets a specific dataset ID, and queries use `FROM dataset` syntax
2. **Single Dataset Queries**: Due to Domo API design, each query operates on one dataset at a time
3. **Column Names**: All queries use the actual column names from the SmartScout schema (e.g., ASIN, MONTHLYSALES)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**: The server handles Domo API rate limits automatically. If you encounter rate limit errors, wait a moment before retrying.

2. **Large Result Sets**: If queries return too much data, try:
   - Adding more specific filters
   - Reducing the limit parameter
   - Using aggregation queries instead of raw data

3. **Connection Errors**: Ensure your Domo credentials are correct and the instance URL is properly formatted.

## Development

To run in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Security

- API credentials are stored in environment variables
- Only SELECT queries are allowed in custom SQL
- All user inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection
- Token limits prevent data exfiltration
